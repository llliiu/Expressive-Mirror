# Expressive-Mirror

##### Expressive Mirror is an interactive installation to generate real-time digital paintings which expressively reflects objects captured by a web camera. We build a computational model to break every single frame image from video stream and reassemble it in an abstract form. Specifically, the model cuts the whole image into thousands mini polygons based on an adapted Voronoi algorithm, and each polygon successively rotates and scales at a certain degree. In order to highlight the expression of abstract, the model picks a group of dominant colors from a pre-selected featured painting from Jean Metzinger and Pablo Picasso in Cubisim. Each polygon compares the color at its center position with the color group to find the closet color in the group to fill. By expressively displaying filtered information of a space, Expressive Mirror provides a real-time environment to dynamically examine the recognition of presence by evoking people to aware the relationship between the subject matter and the objects of the real world.
